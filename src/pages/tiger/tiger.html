  <h1>TIGER</h1>
  <h4>ORIGIN</h4>
  <p>
    The word Panthera is probably of Oriental origin and retraceable to the Ancient Greek word panther, the Latin word panthera,
    the Old French word pantère, most likely meaning "the yellowish animal", or from pandarah meaning whitish-yellow. The
    derivation from Greek pan- ("all") and ther ("beast").The word specific name tigris derives
    from the Classical Greek language τίγρις meaning "tiger" as well as the river Tigris. These derive from the Old French tigre, itself
    a derivative of the Latin word tigris. The original source may have been the Persian tigra meaning pointed or sharp and
    the Avestan tigrhi meaning an arrow, perhaps referring to the speed with which a tiger launches itself at its prey
